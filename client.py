        #### What is it?

        **JobInsights** is an AI-powered, advanced job searching and interactive application designed to streamline your job search process. It gathers data from popular websites such as Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and ZipRecruiter, providing a personalized and comprehensive job summary and insights for each query.

        #### How it Works?

        **JobInsights** leverages an advanced Large Language Model (LLM), GPT-3.5-turbo by OpenAI, to swiftly analyze and comprehend hundreds of job descriptions. This AI extracts vital details including required skills, experience levels, interview insights, and even offers tutorials and guides for job preparation. This automated process saves significant time by eliminating the need for manual sorting through numerous job postings.

        #### Features

        * **Job Summarization:** Automatically generates concise summaries of job descriptions, highlighting key details for quick understanding of job requirements.
        * **Skill Matching:** Identifies the most relevant skills for each job, allowing you to tailor your resume and cover letter effectively.
        * **Interview Insights:** Provides interview questions and tips based on job descriptions, aiding in interview preparation.
        * **Chat Functionality:** Enables interaction with the AI to inquire about specific job preferences or seek career advice.
