            Welcome to the Data Extraction feature! Follow these steps to efficiently extract job data from the platform.

            1. **Select Site Name:**
            - Options:
                - Indeed
                - LinkedIn
                - Glassdoor
                - Other 
            - Instruction: Choose the job site from the list.

            2. **Location (Optional):**
            - Prompt: Enter the location where you want to search for jobs.
            - Example: "Bangalore, India"
            - Instruction: If you wish to specify a location, enter the city, state, or region. This step is optional and can be left blank to search nationwide.

            3. **Search Term:**
            - Prompt: Enter the job title or keywords related to the job you are searching for.
            - Example: "Machine Learning Engineer (Entry Level)"
            - Instruction: Input the specific job title or keywords that match the jobs you are interested in.

            4. **Results Wanted:**
            - Prompt: Specify the number of job listings you want to retrieve.
            - Example: "1"
            - Instruction: Enter the desired number of results. This determines how many job listings will be extracted.

            5. **Country (Optional):**
            - Prompt: Enter the country for the job search.
            - Example: "India"
            - Instruction: If you want to narrow down your search to a specific country, enter the country name. This step is optional.

            **Example Workflow:**
            - Select Site Name: LinkedIn
            - Location (Optional): "Bangalore, India"
            - Search Term: "Machine Learning Engineer (Entry Level)"
            - Results Wanted: "1"
            - Country (Optional): "India"

           * For faster and better results, Indeed is recommended.
