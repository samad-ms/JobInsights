**JOB DESCRIPTION SUMMARY**  

Thanks to several new funding sources from the Institute of Education Sciences, National Science Foundation, and the U.S. Department of Education, the E-TRIALS Project (https://www.etrialstestbed.org/) at WPI is able to fund a full-time post-doctoral position. The position will support and advance research across dozens of funded projects with Dr. Neil Heffernan (https://www.neilheffernan.net/).
  

  

In addition to research, the position will be expected to actively learn and assist in grant writing. Because WPI's policy restricts postdocs from serving as Co-PIs, Dr. Heffernan hires postdocs with the ""Research Scientist"" title so he can list these individuals as Co-PIs for NSF proposals. This experience will give you a competitive advantage on the job market; the last three postdocs in this role had one or more funded NSF proposals on their CV when they moved on from WPI.  

  

If you have questions, please send them to akao@wpi.edu. Formal applications must be submitted via WPI and will be reviewed on a rolling basis until filled.
