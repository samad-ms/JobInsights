This posting is under the Associate Laboratory Directorate for Weapons Engineering (ALDW).  

  

This position will be filled at either the R&D Engineer 2 or 3 level, depending on the skills of the selected candidate. Additional job responsibilities (outlined below) will be assigned if the candidate is hired at the higher level.  

  

We are seeking a candidate with strong programming skills and experience with experimental test data to join the Test Engineering Data Analysis team. Our mission is to integrate measurement data and employ those data to provide accurate, timely, data-driven products in support of the annual assessment, stockpile modernization, and other national security missions. The team develops and maintains the Echo data analysis software package, which is an object-oriented, MATLAB-based analysis environment that serves as our primary tool to execute our test data analysis mission.  

  

Our team collaborates closely with engineers and scientists collecting experimental data-especially mechanical, thermal, and blast test data. We are the first consumers of those data, converting data from disparate acquisition formats into a standard format archived in a central repository. We then analyze data, producing figures, tables, and reports, assessing whether a given test met its objectives and interrogating the data to understand the response of our systems better.  

  

**R&D Engineer 2 $99,200 - $164,100**  

  

At the R&D Engineer 2 level, you will distill data, aggregate information, and deliver reproducible analysis products with a clearly traceable history. You will perform data quality reviews and ensure that all collected data is readily available in a central repository, while continuously contributing to a collaborative code base of data analysis tools. You will be required to work with system and test engineers to develop experimental plans and test environments, apply your own application expertise to provide solutions for both directed and exploratory data analysis questions, and conduct peer review of other analysts' results.  

  

**R&D Engineer 3 $119,200 - $201,100**  

  

In addition to what was outlined at the lower level, at the R&D Engineer 3 level you will be required to provide technical leadership to members of an analysis team, interface with customers, and engage in strategic planning to pursue new streams of relevant data.  

  

**What You Need**  

  

**Minimum Job Requirements:**  

  

**Engineering Expertise**  

  

Familiarity with one or more of the following subjects: signal processing, programming, time and frequency domain analysis, or statistical analysis.  

  

**Communication and Teamwork**  

  

Demonstrated, successful experience working in an integrated team environment; ability to manage multiple tasks in an environment of shifting priorities; strong interpersonal, oral and written communication skills and ability to interact effectively with all levels of personnel and external customers.

**How You Will Be Evaluated**
-----------------------------


You will be evaluated for this job based on how well you meet the qualifications above.


As this position is being advertised under DEU and Merit Promotion hiring procedures, applicants will be rated on the extent and quality of experience and education relevant to the duties of the position using the hiring procedures outlined below.


**How You Will Be Evaluated-DEU Hiring Procedures**



The FCC determines the BEST QUALIFIED CANDIDATES based on the major job related competencies and evaluation of your knowledge, skills, and abilities reflected in your application and supporting documents using the CATEGORY RATING PROCESS. **Time in grade restrictions do not apply to DEU hiring procedures.**



All eligible applicants under Delegated Examining (DEU) will be placed in one of the following three categories:



1. Highly Qualified (Score 90-100) - the applicants possessing a background that demonstrates a superior level of major job related competencies and possession of all evaluation criteria;



2. Fully Qualified (Score 80-89) - the applicants possessing a background that demonstrates a satisfactory level of major job related competencies and possession of the evaluation criteria; and



3. Minimally Qualified (Score of 70-79)- the applicants possessing only the specialized experience described in the vacancy announcement. An automated score is administered based on the on-line application process used.



Eligible applicants will receive a numerical rating based on their responses to the job specific questions for this position. Application of Veterans Preference: The category rating process does not add veterans' preference points or apply the ""rule of three"" but protects the rights of veterans by placing them ahead of non-preference eligibles within each category. Preference eligibles who meet the minimum qualification requirements and who have compensable service-connected disability at least 10 percent MUST be listed in the highest quality category, except when the position being filled is scientific or professional at the GS-9 grade level or higher.



A selecting official may make selection from the highest quality category (""HIGHLY QUALIFIED"") provided no preference eligible in that category is passed over to select a non-preference eligible in the same category. **Qualified disabled veterans (30% disabled veterans and at least 10% disabled veterans) who meet the qualification criteria float to the top of the Highly Qualified category and by law must be referred over non-veterans. Non-veterans are strictly prohibited from being referred or selected over qualified disabled veterans.**

There are several parts to the application process that affect the overall evaluation of your application including:



1. the core questions  

2. the vacancy questions  

3. supplemental documentation (e.g., DD-214, SF-50, SF-15, transcripts), if applicable; and
  

4. your resume.



Applicants will be rated ineligible, if they do not respond to job specific questions, provide supplemental documents and submit resume. For more information, please click on Rating Process.


**Merit Promotion Procedures**

  


Applicants under Merit Promotion will be considered in accordance with the agency's merit promotion plan and union agreement. **Time in grade restrictions apply.**



Under Merit Promotion procedures, applicants must meet the qualifications criteria and receive a score of 90 or above in order to be deemed as BEST QUALIFIED. Candidates who ask to be considered non-competitively only have to receive a score of 70.
